## 🧩 Data Model — Star Schema

![Model View](Screenshots/ModelView.png)

The data is structured using a **Star Schema** with one central Fact table connected to Dimension tables:

| Table | Type |
|---|---|
| `Fact Table` | Fact — core transactions |
| `Product Dim` | Product, Category, SubCategory |
| `Territory Dim` | Territory, TerritoryGroup |
| `Date Dim` | OrderDate |
| `Status Dim` | Status, StatusID |
| `ShipMethod Dim` | ShipMethod, ShipMethodID |
| `Measures Table` | All DAX measures |

---

## 📐 DAX Measures

All measures are stored in a dedicated **Measures Table**:

```dax
# Orders        = DISTINCTCOUNT(Fact[OrderID])
# Order Details = DISTINCTCOUNT('Fact Table'[OrderDetailID])
Total Sub-Total = SUM(Fact[Sub Total])
Total Tax       = SUM(Fact[TaxAmt])
Total Freight   = SUM(Fact[Freight])
Total Due       = SUM(Fact[TotalDue])
```
